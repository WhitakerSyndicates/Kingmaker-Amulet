      <h2>The Curse of the Kingmaker Amulet</h2>
      <p>
        The Kingmaker Amulet was forged by the Maker—a mysterious architect of fate—to challenge the fortitude and ambition of the most accomplished cryptocurrency investors. For only one may be crowned King of Cryptocurrency at any given time, a title bestowed solely upon the possessor of the Amulet. Yet, the Amulet is cursed: its master can never willingly sell it. Only a bold Usurper—one deemed more worthy than the current ruler—can seize it away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Amulet is both greedy and merciless. To claim it, an aspirant must pay a price that is 10% above the previous King’s acquisition cost. When a new claimant triumphs, the former ruler is honored with 101% of their initial payment—a modest bonus preserving their legacy. But be ye warned! A dire prophecy looms: if 365 days pass without a new, worthy challenger, the Amulet will revert to its original price, stripping the reigning King of all accrued value and making him a King in Exile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining 9% of the transaction is transformed into a sacred tribute from the Amulet, which is divided among a revered council. This council is composed of three permanent custodians: the Maker, the King of Time (the sovereign who has held the Amulet the longest), and the King of Usurpers—a title reserved for the challenger who has most frequently demonstrated their worth by usurping the throne. In addition, up to four Kings in Exile may join the council, expanding it into an assembly of seven, each sharing in the tribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, when a fifth King in Exile emerges, the earliest among them shall be reborn as a King Eternal. Of the 9% tribute, the Amulet will award the Kings Eternal 2% divided among them forever, gradually diluting in value as more ascend to eternal sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the Kingmaker Amulet endures—a cursed relic that both elevates and condemns, inviting those who dare to prove their worth and seize its formidable power, all while their legacy is forever reshaped by destiny.
